* Have fun

## What Success Looks Like
You come away from this with greater confidence in yourself and your skills
 
## User Stories
These little stories are the features of this project. They tell us what we want to be able to do.

### As a user, I want to...
1. ... write a note with my idea on it
2. ... move my note off it's pad and stick it where I like on the screen
3. ... keep writing new notes and add more to the screen
4. ... when the screen is full or I'm done with an idea, dump the note in the rubbish bin

### Stretch Goal
If we acomplish all of the above and are feeling really clever...

1. ... have the note board remember all my notes for when I come back next time
